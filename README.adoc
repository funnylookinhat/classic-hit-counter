= Classic Hit Counter

Add a fancy visitor counter to your website - _now with analytics!_

== TODO List

* Setup cache control headers
** 1 hour

*Basic implementation goals:*

* Define domain to accept requests for
** Check referrer matches, if not, just return count.
* On request:
** Check if referrer matches site, if so - update count and return new image
** Otherwise return previous image
* Response headers:
** If referrer came in, give them a cookie with their visitor number
** Expires in 24h
* Cookie logic
** Track which pages they've seen
** If they have a cookie, just return previous image.
** If cookie doesn't show a page hit, track page hit.

*Things worth making configurable:*

* Small vs. Large Images
* Different Image Styles
* Minimum Digits
* Cookies to not double-count in 24h? configurable period

*Tracking Ideas*

* Referrers
* User Agents
* Daily Totals
