= Classic Hit Counter

Add a fancy visitor counter to your website - _now with analytics!_

== Current Features

* Generates a counter image in one of styles (Configurable via ENV).
** Counter images are generated in a worker.
* Optionally only count traffic from accepted domains (Configurable via ENV).
** e.g. if someone hits /count.png from outside of a page, there will be no
   referrer present, and thus the count can be ignored.
* A test page to load test the functionality (or just for fun to watch the
  numbers go up).
** Accessible via /test.html - only when env `DEV_MODE === "ENABLED"`
* Stats are available at /stats.json

== TODO List
