= Classic Hit Counter

Add a fancy visitor counter to your website - _now with analytics!_

== Current Features

* Generates a counter image in one of styles (Configurable via ENV).
** Counter images are generated in a worker.
* Optionally only count traffic from accepted domains (Configurable via ENV).
** e.g. if someone hits /count.png from outside of a page, there will be no
   referrer present, and thus the count can be ignored.
* A test page to load test the functionality (or just for fun to watch the
  numbers go up).
** Accessible via /test.html - only when env `DEV_MODE === "ENABLED"`
* Stats are available at /stats.json

== TODO List

* Consider cache control headers
** 1 hour
** Make configurable - because otherwise we want it to reload every time.
* Document configuration
* Release Workflow
** Grab inspiration from this - https://github.com/wuespace/envar/blob/main/scripts/release.ts#L111-L115

== Some things I've learned

=== deno compile + node packages

deno compile doesn't work if you're using node: package that require building
an architecture specific binary.

Sharp isn't pulled in correctly, so we're left with just deno run.

=== files are read relative to the CWD

Don't fight it - if you have a file in assets/foo/bar/baz.txt and you're in
src/qux/blargle.ts - just read the file with `./assets/foo/bar/baz.txt`

It's weird - but I suspect that this will help long term with compiling assets
into binaries.
